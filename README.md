## Instructions

All that's required is to point your browser to the [website](https://customer-table.netlify.com/)!

If you'd like to run the app locally:

1. Navigate to [repo](https://github.com/HanifCarroll/Customer-Table)
2. Clone locally using
   `git clone git@github.com:HanifCarroll/Customer-Table.git`
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`
4. Start your server using `npm start`
5. Navigate to app in [browser](http://localhost:3000)

## Requirements

#### Create an app to search and view customer data.

The app lists results in a paginated table, and searching for terms updates the
list with a new, filtered list of data.

## Discussion

The app uses the following technologies: HTML, CSS, and React.
I used [create-react-app](https://goo.gl/26jfy4) as a starting point for the app.

The two external libraries used are:

1. [Fuse.js](http://fusejs.io/) for search functionality.
2. [React Table](https://react-table.js.org/#/story/readme) for the table functionality.
